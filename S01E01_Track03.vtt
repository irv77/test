00:01:43.438 --> 00:01:47.150
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:51.821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

00:01:51.904 --> 00:01:53.865
-It is almost here.
-What is it?

00:01:53.948 --> 00:01:55.283
What if it's the Demogorgon?

00:01:55.366 --> 00:01:58.411
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

00:01:58.494 --> 00:01:59.537
It's not the Demogorgon.

00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:01.873
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

00:02:01.956 --> 00:02:04.083
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

00:02:07.545 --> 00:02:08.963
Wait a minute.

00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:11.591
Did you hear that?

00:02:11.674 --> 00:02:13.092
That... that sound?

00:02:13.176 --> 00:02:15.845
Boom... boom...

00:02:15.928 --> 00:02:17.680
- Boom!

00:02:17.764 --> 00:02:19.641
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

00:02:19.724 --> 00:02:21.392
That came from something else.

00:02:23.853 --> 00:02:25.855
- The Demogorgon!

00:02:25.938 --> 00:02:27.398
-We're in deep shit.
-Will, your action!

00:02:27.482 --> 00:02:28.775
-I don't know!
-Fireball him!

00:02:28.858 --> 00:02:30.151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:32.070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

00:02:32.153 --> 00:02:34.697
-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
-Cast Protection.

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:37.492
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

00:02:37.575 --> 00:02:39.369
It stomps towards you.

00:02:39.452 --> 00:02:40.453
-Boom!
-Fireball him!

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:42.830
-Another stomp, boom!
-Cast Protection.

00:02:42.914 --> 00:02:45.750
- He roars in anger!

00:02:45.833 --> 00:02:47.335
- Fireball!

00:02:47.418 --> 00:02:49.045
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

00:02:49.128 --> 00:02:50.838
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

00:02:50.922 --> 00:02:52.465
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

00:02:52.548 --> 00:02:53.716
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.385
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:02:55.468 --> 00:02:56.552
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

00:02:56.636 --> 00:02:57.720
No, I can't find it!

00:02:57.804 --> 00:02:59.472
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:01.349
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

00:03:01.432 --> 00:03:03.559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

00:03:03.643 --> 00:03:06.813
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

00:03:06.938 --> 00:03:09.607
-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
-It's a school night, Michael.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:13.778
-But that'll ruin the flow!
-Michael--

00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:15.113
I'm serious, Mom.

00:03:15.196 --> 00:03:17.657
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:19.659
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

00:03:19.742 --> 00:03:21.619
You've been playing for ten hours?

00:03:22.954 --> 00:03:26.749
-Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
-I think you should listen to your mother.

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:30.294
--Dang dumb piece of junk.

00:03:31.337 --> 00:03:33.297
Oh, I got it!

00:03:33.381 --> 00:03:35.258
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?

00:03:35.925 --> 00:03:38.469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.267
Yo, hey, guys.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.227
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:50.857
Yeah.

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.234
No, I don't think...

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.945
Yeah, he's cute.

00:03:56.028 --> 00:03:59.365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:00.908
-Barb, you're not--
-Hey, Nancy.

00:04:01.784 --> 00:04:03.161
There's a slice left if you want it.

00:04:03.244 --> 00:04:05.580
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:16.382
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:18.259
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

00:04:18.342 --> 00:04:20.845
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

00:04:20.928 --> 00:04:22.680
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

00:04:22.764 --> 00:04:24.098
She's always been a real jerk.

00:04:24.182 --> 00:04:26.058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:28.519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

00:04:28.603 --> 00:04:29.812
Four years ago!

00:04:29.937 --> 00:04:31.355
- Just saying.
- Later.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.984
-It was a seven.
-Huh?

00:04:35.067 --> 00:04:36.819
The roll, it was a seven.

00:04:37.904 --> 00:04:40.114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:43.159
See you tomorrow.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.844
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

00:05:03.179 --> 00:05:05.264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

00:05:05.348 --> 00:05:07.016
-Any comic?
-Yeah.

00:05:07.892 --> 00:05:10.019
Hey! Hey!

00:05:10.102 --> 00:05:12.063
I didn't say "go"!

00:05:14.106 --> 00:05:16.150
Get back here!

00:05:16.234 --> 00:05:18.361
I'm gonna kill you!

00:05:18.444 --> 00:05:20.863
I'll take your X-Men 134!

00:05:27.161 --> 00:05:28.704
Son of a bitch.

00:06:27.763 --> 00:06:29.140
Mom?

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:31.767
- Jonathan? Mom?

00:06:53.706 --> 00:06:56.417
- Hello? Hello?

00:09:29.111 --> 00:09:31.405
And that's it
for News Center this morning.

00:09:31.489 --> 00:09:32.823
Thanks for joining us.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:35.201
Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.

00:09:35.284 --> 00:09:36.702
All right, thank you, Donna.

00:09:36.786 --> 00:09:37.870
Turning now to local news,

00:09:37.953 --> 00:09:41.373
we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.

00:09:41.457 --> 00:09:44.418
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:46.879
leaving many residents in the dark.

00:09:46.962 --> 00:09:49.090
The cause of the outage is still unknown.

00:09:49.173 --> 00:09:51.383
We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:54.011
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

00:09:54.095 --> 00:09:56.680
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

00:09:56.764 --> 00:09:58.307
within the next several hours.

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:26.043
Mmm.

00:10:57.491 --> 00:10:59.702
In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight

00:10:59.785 --> 00:11:01.078
or at least pack an umbrella.

00:11:01.162 --> 00:11:03.581
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

00:11:08.085 --> 00:11:10.087
Where the hell are they?

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.590
-Jonathan?
-Check the couch!

00:11:12.673 --> 00:11:13.799
Ugh, I did.

00:11:14.925 --> 00:11:17.386
Oh... Got them.

00:11:18.512 --> 00:11:20.848
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

00:11:20.931 --> 00:11:22.766
-Yeah, see you later.
-Where's Will?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:23.934
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

00:11:24.018 --> 00:11:25.144
- He's probably still sleeping.

00:11:25.227 --> 00:11:28.355
-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
-Mom, I'm making breakfast.

00:11:28.439 --> 00:11:30.274
I told you this a thousand times.

00:11:30.357 --> 00:11:33.986
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

00:11:37.364 --> 00:11:40.743
-He came home last night, right?
-He's not in his room?

00:11:40.826 --> 00:11:43.120
-Did he come home or not?
-I don't know.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.455
-You don't know?
-No.

00:11:44.538 --> 00:11:46.582
I got home late.
I was working.

00:11:46.665 --> 00:11:47.708
You were working?

00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

00:11:49.793 --> 00:11:51.253
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

00:11:51.337 --> 00:11:54.048
-Jonathan, we've talked about this.
-I know, I know.

00:11:54.131 --> 00:11:56.050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

00:11:56.133 --> 00:11:58.302
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:01.055
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

00:12:01.138 --> 00:12:03.724
I can't believe you sometimes.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:10.272
--That's disgusting.

00:12:10.356 --> 00:12:12.566
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:14.401
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

00:12:14.485 --> 00:12:16.528
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

00:12:16.612 --> 00:12:17.780
- Hey!
- Quiet!

00:12:17.863 --> 00:12:19.573
-Language.
-Are you kidding?

00:12:19.657 --> 00:12:21.033
Was that Will I heard back there?

00:12:21.116 --> 00:12:22.618
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

00:12:22.701 --> 00:12:24.119
Will didn't spend the night?

00:12:24.203 --> 00:12:26.622
No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:28.040
Why? He's not home?

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:31.961
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

00:12:32.044 --> 00:12:34.046
-Thank you so much. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

00:12:58.988 --> 00:13:00.531
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

00:13:00.614 --> 00:13:02.449
He probably just
went to class early again.

00:13:02.533 --> 00:13:05.035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:07.037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:10.374
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.085
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

00:13:14.837 --> 00:13:18.757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

00:13:22.511 --> 00:13:24.346
I'd go with Toothless.

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:27.891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

00:13:27.975 --> 00:13:29.727
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

00:13:29.810 --> 00:13:31.812
"I told you a million times."

00:13:31.895 --> 00:13:33.939
--Do the arm thing.

00:13:34.732 --> 00:13:36.066
Do it, freak!

00:13:42.406 --> 00:13:44.658
God, it gets me every time.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:48.829
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:51.081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

00:13:51.165 --> 00:13:53.042
Like Mr. Fantastic.

00:13:53.125 --> 00:13:55.377
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:05.512
So, did he call?

00:14:05.596 --> 00:14:08.140
Keep your voice down.

00:14:08.223 --> 00:14:09.808
Did he?

00:14:09.892 --> 00:14:11.643
I told you, it's not like that.

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:15.981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:17.983
We just...

00:14:19.109 --> 00:14:20.611
made out a couple times.

00:14:20.694 --> 00:14:24.073
"We just... made out a couple times."

00:14:24.156 --> 00:14:25.491
Nance, seriously,

00:14:25.574 --> 00:14:27.659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

00:14:27.743 --> 00:14:29.161
No, I'm not.

00:14:29.244 --> 00:14:32.915
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

00:14:32.998 --> 00:14:35.793
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol--

00:14:35.876 --> 00:14:37.169
Oh, that's gross!

00:14:37.252 --> 00:14:39.421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

00:14:40.255 --> 00:14:42.341
- Two-time thing.

00:14:47.179 --> 00:14:48.472
You were saying?

00:14:58.899 --> 00:15:00.359
-Steve...
-Mmm-hmm?

00:15:00.442 --> 00:15:02.111
-I have to go.
-In a minute.

00:15:03.570 --> 00:15:05.864
Steve.
I really, like...

00:15:05.948 --> 00:15:07.783
Seriously, I have to go.

00:15:07.866 --> 00:15:09.243
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

00:15:09.326 --> 00:15:11.203
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

00:15:11.286 --> 00:15:14.206
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

00:15:14.289 --> 00:15:16.542
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:18.335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:20.587
-Well, then, just let me help.
-You failed chem.

00:15:20.671 --> 00:15:22.673
-C-minus.
-Well, in that case...

00:15:22.756 --> 00:15:25.092
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

00:15:25.175 --> 00:15:28.137
-Are you crazy? My mom would not--
-I'll climb through your window.

00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.389
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

00:15:30.472 --> 00:15:31.723
You are crazy.

00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:33.642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

00:15:33.725 --> 00:15:35.018
We can just...

00:15:35.102 --> 00:15:37.020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

00:15:37.104 --> 00:15:40.065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

00:15:40.149 --> 00:15:43.569
Steve... I have to study.

00:15:43.652 --> 00:15:45.362
I'm not kidding.

00:15:45.446 --> 00:15:47.739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:00.043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

00:16:00.878 --> 00:16:02.254
To study.

00:16:15.476 --> 00:16:16.768
Good of you to show.

00:16:16.852 --> 00:16:20.522
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

00:16:20.606 --> 00:16:24.276
-Hey, Chief.
-Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

00:16:24.359 --> 00:16:25.360
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

00:16:25.444 --> 00:16:27.988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

00:16:29.156 --> 00:16:30.699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

00:16:30.782 --> 00:16:33.744
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:34.828
Phil Larson called.

00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:37.581
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

00:16:37.664 --> 00:16:39.124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

00:16:39.208 --> 00:16:41.460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

00:16:41.543 --> 00:16:43.086
On a more pressing matter,

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.214
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

00:16:45.297 --> 00:16:48.050
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

00:16:48.133 --> 00:16:50.344
-Just give me a minute.
-Joyce is very upset.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:52.304
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

00:16:52.387 --> 00:16:54.723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

00:16:54.806 --> 00:16:58.685
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

00:17:09.154 --> 00:17:11.949
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

00:17:12.032 --> 00:17:14.618
And I apologize again.

00:17:14.701 --> 00:17:16.078
I'm going out of my mind!

00:17:16.161 --> 00:17:19.748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

00:17:21.917 --> 00:17:23.460
-He wouldn't do that.
-Well, you never know.

00:17:23.544 --> 00:17:25.254
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

00:17:25.337 --> 00:17:26.922
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

00:17:27.005 --> 00:17:28.674
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

00:17:28.757 --> 00:17:31.718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

00:17:31.802 --> 00:17:34.304
He's not like... most.

00:17:34.388 --> 00:17:38.267
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:40.185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

00:17:40.269 --> 00:17:42.312
-They laugh at him, his clothes--
-His clothes?

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.356
-What's wrong with his clothes?
-I don't know.

00:17:44.439 --> 00:17:46.733
-Does that matter?
-Maybe.

00:17:46.817 --> 00:17:49.861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

00:17:49.945 --> 00:17:53.657
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:55.075
Called him a fag.

00:17:55.158 --> 00:17:59.079
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.

00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:02.958
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

00:18:05.085 --> 00:18:09.423
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

00:18:09.506 --> 00:18:12.259
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

00:18:14.303 --> 00:18:17.514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

00:18:17.598 --> 00:18:19.725
the kid is with a parent or relative.

00:18:19.808 --> 00:18:21.310
What about the other time?

00:18:21.393 --> 00:18:24.730
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."

00:18:24.855 --> 00:18:26.857
-What about the other time, the one?
-Joyce.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.066
The one!

00:18:28.150 --> 00:18:29.985
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

00:18:30.068 --> 00:18:31.820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

00:18:31.903 --> 00:18:32.988
in the four years I've been working here?

00:18:33.071 --> 00:18:34.239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

00:18:34.323 --> 00:18:37.451
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:39.244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

00:18:39.328 --> 00:18:41.997
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.790
He will talk to me before he talks to--

00:18:43.874 --> 00:18:45.834
-What, a pig?
-A cop!

00:18:46.918 --> 00:18:49.921
Just find my son, Hop.

00:18:50.005 --> 00:18:51.882
Find him!

00:19:03.477 --> 00:19:04.645
Dr. Brenner.

00:19:06.605 --> 00:19:08.273
This way, gentlemen.

00:19:08.357 --> 00:19:11.193
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

00:19:11.276 --> 00:19:15.113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

00:21:01.303 --> 00:21:03.930
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

00:21:04.014 --> 00:21:05.015
And the girl?

00:21:06.641 --> 00:21:08.769
She can't have gone far.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:03.740
All right, and one more.

00:22:04.699 --> 00:22:06.618
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

00:22:06.701 --> 00:22:08.245
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

00:22:08.328 --> 00:22:10.664
I don't know,
37 points per game average--

00:22:10.747 --> 00:22:12.457
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

00:22:42.612 --> 00:22:44.114
Hey!

00:22:44.197 --> 00:22:45.323
Come here!

00:22:46.074 --> 00:22:47.367
Hey, come here!

00:22:52.038 --> 00:22:54.082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

00:22:56.585 --> 00:22:57.752
What in the hell?

00:22:59.296 --> 00:23:02.132
--Remember, finish chapter 12

00:23:02.215 --> 00:23:06.011
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

00:23:06.094 --> 00:23:08.221
and other forms of science investigation.

00:23:08.305 --> 00:23:12.183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

00:23:12.267 --> 00:23:15.312
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:18.356
So, did it come?

00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:19.816
Sorry, boys.

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:21.776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

00:23:22.986 --> 00:23:23.903
it came.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:28.491
Yes!

00:23:28.575 --> 00:23:30.368
The Heathkit ham shack.

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.911
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

00:23:31.995 --> 00:23:34.039
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

00:23:34.122 --> 00:23:35.290
Think bigger.

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:37.375
-California?
-Bigger.

00:23:37.459 --> 00:23:38.835
Australia?

00:23:39.794 --> 00:23:41.379
--Oh, man!

00:23:41.463 --> 00:23:44.341
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

00:23:44.424 --> 00:23:45.508
Lucas!

00:23:45.592 --> 00:23:46.968
- Sorry.

00:23:49.512 --> 00:23:51.931
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

00:23:52.015 --> 00:23:54.726
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

00:23:56.269 --> 00:23:57.479
What are you doing?

00:23:57.562 --> 00:23:58.730
Hello, this is Dustin,

00:23:58.813 --> 00:24:01.816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:04.069
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

00:24:06.237 --> 00:24:11.076
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

00:24:16.081 --> 00:24:17.624
Okay, okay, okay.

00:24:17.707 --> 00:24:20.669
One at a time, all right?
You.

00:24:21.628 --> 00:24:23.380
-You said he takes what?
-Mirkwood.

00:24:23.463 --> 00:24:26.049
-Mirkwood?
-Yeah.

00:24:26.132 --> 00:24:29.636
-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
-I have not. That sounds made up to me.

00:24:29.719 --> 00:24:31.513
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

00:24:31.596 --> 00:24:34.474
-Well, The Hobbit.
-It doesn't matter.

00:24:34.557 --> 00:24:36.393
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

00:24:36.476 --> 00:24:38.061
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

00:24:38.186 --> 00:24:40.105
-What'd I just say?
-Shut up.

00:24:40.188 --> 00:24:43.483
One at a damn time.
You.

00:24:43.566 --> 00:24:46.778
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

00:24:46.861 --> 00:24:48.238
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

00:24:48.321 --> 00:24:50.824
-Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
-We can show you, if you want.

00:24:50.907 --> 00:24:52.242
I said that I know it!

00:24:52.325 --> 00:24:54.244
-We can help look.
-Yeah.

00:24:54.327 --> 00:24:56.246
- No.

00:24:56.329 --> 00:24:59.457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

00:24:59.541 --> 00:25:00.750
Immediately.

00:25:00.834 --> 00:25:04.629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

00:25:04.713 --> 00:25:05.797
no nonsense.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.841
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

00:25:07.924 --> 00:25:10.719
-The Hobbit.
-Shut up!

00:25:10.802 --> 00:25:12.178
- Hey!
- Stop it!

00:25:13.471 --> 00:25:15.390
Do I make myself clear?

00:25:20.603 --> 00:25:25.150
Do I make myself... clear?

00:25:26.151 --> 00:25:27.944
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

00:25:39.789 --> 00:25:41.499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

00:25:41.583 --> 00:25:43.293
Anybody home?

00:25:43.376 --> 00:25:45.003
Password?

00:25:45.086 --> 00:25:47.046
Uh, Rada...

00:25:48.381 --> 00:25:50.884
Radaga-- Radagast?

00:25:50.967 --> 00:25:53.386
Yeah. You may enter.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:55.930
Thank you, sir.

00:25:56.931 --> 00:25:58.558
So, guess what?

00:25:58.641 --> 00:26:01.102
I got off early and...

00:26:01.186 --> 00:26:03.855
Ta-da!
Poltergeist.

00:26:03.938 --> 00:26:05.482
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

00:26:05.565 --> 00:26:06.941
I changed my mind.

00:26:07.984 --> 00:26:09.819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

00:26:09.903 --> 00:26:12.405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

00:26:12.489 --> 00:26:13.490
Oh, yeah?

00:26:13.573 --> 00:26:15.241
Not even of clowns?

00:26:15.325 --> 00:26:16.409
No.

00:26:16.493 --> 00:26:18.870
What about my witch?

00:26:18.953 --> 00:26:20.371
-No. Mom...
-Ooh...

00:26:20.455 --> 00:26:22.290
-I'm not five anymore.
-But Will Byers...

00:26:22.373 --> 00:26:24.834
-I'm going to cook you up in my--
-Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

00:26:29.172 --> 00:26:30.298
Will?

00:26:30.381 --> 00:26:31.966
- Will?
- Will?

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:34.761
Will?

00:26:37.722 --> 00:26:39.307
-Will?
-Will!

00:26:40.642 --> 00:26:42.101
- Will!
- Will?

00:26:42.185 --> 00:26:43.728
Will!

00:26:43.812 --> 00:26:45.480
Where are you?

00:26:54.864 --> 00:26:56.074
Geez.

00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:58.701
Your parents forget to feed you?

00:27:02.372 --> 00:27:04.207
Is that why you ran away?

00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:08.878
They, uh...

00:27:09.879 --> 00:27:11.047
They hurt you?

00:27:13.925 --> 00:27:15.635
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

00:27:15.718 --> 00:27:17.387
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

00:27:20.431 --> 00:27:21.641
All right.

00:27:23.476 --> 00:27:26.855
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

00:27:27.522 --> 00:27:28.940
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

00:27:29.023 --> 00:27:31.109
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

00:27:32.569 --> 00:27:34.445
We got a deal?

00:27:36.322 --> 00:27:40.076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

00:27:40.159 --> 00:27:43.538
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

00:27:43.621 --> 00:27:45.331
See? Like this. Here.

00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:48.334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

00:27:48.418 --> 00:27:51.880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

00:28:01.222 --> 00:28:02.265
Eleven?

00:28:03.308 --> 00:28:04.601
What's that mean?

00:28:05.476 --> 00:28:07.228
What's it mean?

00:28:08.313 --> 00:28:10.565
-No.
-Well, I'll be damned.

00:28:10.648 --> 00:28:12.358
She speaks.

00:28:12.442 --> 00:28:14.110
"No"? No, what?

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:18.907
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.158
Eleven.

00:28:21.534 --> 00:28:22.577
Yeah.

00:28:23.912 --> 00:28:25.455
What's it mean?

00:28:27.206 --> 00:28:28.625
Eleven.

00:28:30.335 --> 00:28:32.503
All right, then.

00:28:32.587 --> 00:28:34.339
Here you go.

00:28:34.422 --> 00:28:36.174
Take it easy, take it easy.

00:28:38.551 --> 00:28:41.179
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

00:28:41.262 --> 00:28:43.389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

00:28:43.473 --> 00:28:45.099
kidnapped or something.

00:28:46.601 --> 00:28:49.187
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

00:28:49.270 --> 00:28:53.733
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

00:29:20.635 --> 00:29:22.387
Will Byers?

00:29:25.181 --> 00:29:26.557
Will!

00:29:27.809 --> 00:29:30.061
Will Byers?

00:29:33.064 --> 00:29:35.066
Come on, kid!

00:29:35.149 --> 00:29:36.401
Will?

00:29:37.527 --> 00:29:41.322
--Hey! I got something.

00:29:48.371 --> 00:29:51.291
-That his bike?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.

00:29:52.583 --> 00:29:54.210
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

00:29:55.086 --> 00:29:56.629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

00:29:56.713 --> 00:29:58.631
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

00:29:58.715 --> 00:30:00.341
He would've walked it home.

00:30:11.352 --> 00:30:12.312
...get off work if I win.

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:14.063
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

00:30:14.147 --> 00:30:16.941
...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.

00:30:17.025 --> 00:30:18.693
- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.

00:30:28.036 --> 00:30:29.203
Is Lonnie there?

00:30:29.287 --> 00:30:31.581
- Lonnie isn't here right now.
- Can you please--

00:30:31.664 --> 00:30:33.541
-I told you, Lonnie's not here.
-Who is this?

00:30:33.624 --> 00:30:35.626
-His girlfriend, Cynthia.
-Cynthia.

00:30:35.710 --> 00:30:38.421
-Who the hell is this?
-Cynthia, this is Joyce.

00:30:38.504 --> 00:30:40.256
-Who?
-Lonnie's ex-wife.

00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:42.383
-I really need to speak to him--
-Lonnie's not here.

00:30:42.467 --> 00:30:44.344
-Can you please put-- No!
-Why don't you call back later?

00:30:44.427 --> 00:30:45.636
No, not later. Now!

00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:46.888
- Can--

00:30:46.971 --> 00:30:48.389
- Bitch!
- Mom.

00:30:48.473 --> 00:30:50.933
-What?
-You have to stay calm.

00:30:59.692 --> 00:31:00.735
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

00:31:00.818 --> 00:31:03.029
Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:06.866
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

00:31:06.949 --> 00:31:09.452
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

00:31:09.535 --> 00:31:10.703
I need...

00:31:10.787 --> 00:31:13.373
I just need you to call me back,
please, just--

00:31:16.042 --> 00:31:17.794
- Damn it! Damn it!

00:31:17.877 --> 00:31:19.545
--Mom?

00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:20.630
What?

00:31:22.673 --> 00:31:23.841
Cops.

00:31:38.689 --> 00:31:42.235
-It was just lying there?
-Yeah. Cal?

00:31:43.152 --> 00:31:46.823
-Did it have any blood on it, or--
-No, no, no, no, no...

00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:48.408
Phil?

00:31:48.491 --> 00:31:50.910
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

00:31:51.953 --> 00:31:54.831
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

00:31:55.832 --> 00:31:57.250
So...

00:31:58.209 --> 00:31:59.377
maybe he came home.

00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.504
You think I didn't check
my own house?

00:32:01.587 --> 00:32:03.381
I'm not saying that.

00:32:04.298 --> 00:32:07.051
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

00:32:07.135 --> 00:32:09.971
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

00:32:11.597 --> 00:32:12.765
You're not sure?

00:32:24.735 --> 00:32:25.736
Hey.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.115
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

00:32:29.198 --> 00:32:31.701
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

00:33:50.655 --> 00:33:52.323
- Hey!
- Jesus!

00:33:52.406 --> 00:33:54.992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

00:33:55.076 --> 00:33:57.537
--What's going on?

00:33:59.705 --> 00:34:00.831
Hello?

00:34:00.915 --> 00:34:04.001
-Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
-Listen, I want you to call Flo.

00:34:04.085 --> 00:34:05.419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

00:34:05.503 --> 00:34:08.631
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

00:34:08.714 --> 00:34:11.008
Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

00:34:18.057 --> 00:34:20.810
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

00:34:20.893 --> 00:34:22.770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says--

00:34:22.853 --> 00:34:24.355
-I don't care what the chief said.
-Michael!

00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:26.107
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

00:34:26.190 --> 00:34:27.400
More reason to stay put.

00:34:27.483 --> 00:34:29.527
-Mom!
-End of discussion.

00:34:33.739 --> 00:34:37.660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

00:34:37.743 --> 00:34:40.162
-That's cool, right?
-No, not cool.

00:34:40.246 --> 00:34:41.497
What? Why not?

00:34:41.581 --> 00:34:44.792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:47.920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

00:34:48.004 --> 00:34:49.797
-This is such bullshit.
-Language.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:51.299
So we're under house arrest?

00:34:51.382 --> 00:34:53.301
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

00:34:53.384 --> 00:34:55.678
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-Nancy, take that back.

00:34:55.761 --> 00:34:57.305
-No!
-You're just pissed off

00:34:57.388 --> 00:34:59.348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

00:35:00.975 --> 00:35:02.226
-Steve?
-Who is Steve?

00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:04.729
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!

00:35:04.812 --> 00:35:06.606
- Language!

00:35:08.274 --> 00:35:09.692
Nancy, come back.

00:35:10.526 --> 00:35:11.777
Come back!

00:35:11.861 --> 00:35:15.281
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:17.033
You see, Michael?

00:35:17.116 --> 00:35:19.410
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

00:35:19.493 --> 00:35:23.080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

00:35:23.164 --> 00:35:25.207
That is really unfair, son.

00:35:25.291 --> 00:35:26.500
We care.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.174
-Mike!
-Let him go.

00:35:35.885 --> 00:35:38.304
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

00:35:39.055 --> 00:35:40.598
What did I do?

00:35:42.933 --> 00:35:45.519
Hey! What'd I do?

00:35:48.564 --> 00:35:50.608
- Will!
- Will Byers!

00:35:50.691 --> 00:35:51.734
Will!

00:35:51.817 --> 00:35:53.653
Will, we're here for you, bud!

00:35:56.530 --> 00:35:58.741
He's a good student.

00:35:58.824 --> 00:36:02.244
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:03.954
Great one, actually.

00:36:04.455 --> 00:36:06.374
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

00:36:06.457 --> 00:36:09.752
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

00:36:09.835 --> 00:36:11.837
I always had
a distaste for science.

00:36:11.921 --> 00:36:13.881
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

00:36:13.964 --> 00:36:16.300
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

00:36:16.384 --> 00:36:19.011
Ratliff?
You bet.

00:36:19.095 --> 00:36:21.263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

00:36:21.347 --> 00:36:25.142
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

00:36:25.768 --> 00:36:27.269
Sarah, my daughter...

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:32.817
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:35.361
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

00:36:35.444 --> 00:36:37.196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

00:36:37.738 --> 00:36:39.490
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

00:36:39.573 --> 00:36:42.368
-Maybe I'll get her in my class.
-No, she, uh...

00:36:42.451 --> 00:36:44.995
She lives with her mom in the city.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:48.541
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

00:36:50.751 --> 00:36:53.629
-She died a few years back.
-Sorry?

00:36:53.713 --> 00:36:54.964
His kid.

00:37:07.435 --> 00:37:08.978
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

00:37:09.061 --> 00:37:11.897
-Lucas?
-Hey, it's Lucas.

00:37:11.981 --> 00:37:12.982
I know it's you.

00:37:13.065 --> 00:37:16.235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

00:37:16.318 --> 00:37:17.945
I'm done. Over.

00:37:18.028 --> 00:37:20.448
I'm worried about Will. Over.

00:37:20.531 --> 00:37:22.575
Yeah.

00:37:24.410 --> 00:37:26.328
This is crazy. Over.

00:37:26.412 --> 00:37:28.038
I was thinking...

00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:33.461
He cast Fireball.

00:37:33.544 --> 00:37:37.298
-Over.
-What's your point? Over.

00:37:37.381 --> 00:37:42.094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

00:37:42.178 --> 00:37:44.054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

00:37:44.138 --> 00:37:45.264
Over.

00:37:48.058 --> 00:37:50.478
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

00:38:21.300 --> 00:38:22.301
What are you doing here?

00:38:22.384 --> 00:38:24.678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

00:38:24.762 --> 00:38:27.598
-I figured we'd just study here.
-No. No way.

00:38:27.681 --> 00:38:29.934
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

00:38:30.017 --> 00:38:31.811
So just... bear with me.

00:38:34.855 --> 00:38:35.856
What'd I tell you?

00:38:37.274 --> 00:38:38.400
Ninja.

00:38:52.456 --> 00:38:53.916
You like that ice cream, huh?

00:38:55.167 --> 00:38:56.585
Smile looks good on you.

00:38:57.419 --> 00:38:59.004
You know, smile?

00:39:08.013 --> 00:39:09.765
All right.
You just sit tight.

00:39:09.849 --> 00:39:13.227
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

00:39:15.437 --> 00:39:18.107
--Yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:39:19.233 --> 00:39:21.735
-Hey, can I help you?
-Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

00:39:21.819 --> 00:39:24.071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

00:39:24.154 --> 00:39:26.907
-So try back tomorrow morning.
-Connie Frazier. Social Services.

00:39:26.991 --> 00:39:29.869
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

00:39:29.952 --> 00:39:32.788
-That's a heck of a drive.
-Not too bad this time of night.

00:39:32.872 --> 00:39:35.124
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

00:39:35.207 --> 00:39:39.169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

00:39:39.253 --> 00:39:41.881
-Children I work with usually are.
-Right, right.

00:39:42.464 --> 00:39:45.301
-So, where is she?
-Right. She's in the kitchen.

00:39:45.384 --> 00:39:47.219
-Come on up. I'll introduce you.
-Thank you.

00:39:47.303 --> 00:39:49.096
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

00:39:49.179 --> 00:39:50.222
-It's fine.
-You know, it's funny.

00:39:50.306 --> 00:39:52.725
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the--

00:40:23.547 --> 00:40:26.467
Ah, man.
This is it.

00:40:35.225 --> 00:40:37.061
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

00:40:40.105 --> 00:40:41.774
-I think maybe we should go back.
-No.

00:40:41.857 --> 00:40:44.485
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

00:40:44.568 --> 00:40:45.694
Come on.

00:40:46.820 --> 00:40:50.157
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

00:40:54.828 --> 00:40:56.163
Hey, guys, wait up.

00:40:56.705 --> 00:40:58.123
Wait up!

"Which polymers occur naturally?"

Starch and cellulose.

Mmm.

Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

00:41:21.563 --> 00:41:23.399
You said you wanted to help.

00:41:24.441 --> 00:41:25.651
How about this? How about...

00:41:25.734 --> 00:41:27.277
How about every time
that you get something right,

00:41:27.361 --> 00:41:28.862
I have to take off
an item of clothing.

00:41:28.946 --> 00:41:30.531
But every time
that you get something wrong--

00:41:30.614 --> 00:41:31.824
-Uh, pass.
-Oh, come on.

00:41:31.907 --> 00:41:32.950
-Come on.
-No.

00:41:33.033 --> 00:41:34.410

That's what I meant.

Yeah, that's not what you said.

-No.
-No?

00:41:50.551 --> 00:41:52.886

Do you need help, or...

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:54.013
No.

Steve, come on.

00:42:17.244 --> 00:42:18.245

To... to get in my room and then...

00:42:33.260 --> 00:42:35.846
-get another notch on your belt.
-No. Nancy, no.

00:42:35.929 --> 00:42:38.057
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.725
You mean, you're not a slut.

00:42:40.559 --> 00:42:41.643
That's not what I'm saying.

00:42:41.727 --> 00:42:43.479
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

00:42:43.979 --> 00:42:45.230
Shut up.

00:42:48.108 --> 00:42:49.485
Bad Steve.

00:42:49.568 --> 00:42:53.113
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

00:42:53.697 --> 00:42:55.741
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

00:42:56.658 --> 00:42:58.702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

00:43:05.125 --> 00:43:07.711
"Compared to the rate
of inorganic reactions,

00:43:07.795 --> 00:43:11.548
the rate of organic reactions
is generally..."

00:43:14.551 --> 00:43:17.596
Jonathan, wow.
You took these?

00:43:18.514 --> 00:43:20.015
These are great.

00:43:21.141 --> 00:43:24.103
Wow, they really are.

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:28.357
- I know I haven't been there for you.
- I've been...

00:43:28.440 --> 00:43:30.526
working so hard and I...

00:43:30.609 --> 00:43:32.444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

00:43:32.528 --> 00:43:34.988
barely know what's going on with you.

00:43:35.072 --> 00:43:37.825
All right?
I am sorry about that.

00:43:41.203 --> 00:43:42.496
Hey, what is it?

00:43:43.413 --> 00:43:44.748
What is it, honey?

00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.919
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

00:43:49.002 --> 00:43:51.046
-Come on. You can...
-No.

00:43:51.130 --> 00:43:52.297
It's just...

00:43:53.507 --> 00:43:55.300
I should've been there for him.

00:43:55.384 --> 00:43:58.387
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

00:43:58.470 --> 00:44:01.682
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

00:44:01.765 --> 00:44:05.435
- He is... close.
- I know it.  I...

00:44:06.103 --> 00:44:08.814
I feel it in my heart.

00:44:09.565 --> 00:44:12.359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

00:44:15.112 --> 00:44:16.780
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at this.

00:44:16.864 --> 00:44:19.241
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

00:44:21.577 --> 00:44:23.745
-I mean, that's it, right?
-Yeah.

00:44:23.829 --> 00:44:25.622
That's it.
That's the one.

00:44:29.209 --> 00:44:32.129
- Hello?

00:44:32.212 --> 00:44:33.839
- Hello?

00:44:33.922 --> 00:44:34.965
Lonnie?

00:44:35.048 --> 00:44:36.800
-Dad?
-Hopper?

00:44:36.884 --> 00:44:38.927
--Who is this?

00:44:42.222 --> 00:44:43.265
Will?

00:44:44.141 --> 00:44:45.225
-Will?
-It's Will?

00:44:48.061 --> 00:44:49.438
--Mom, it's Will?

00:44:50.439 --> 00:44:51.857
- Who is this?

00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:54.067
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

00:44:54.151 --> 00:44:55.652
Give me back my son!

00:44:57.613 --> 00:44:59.448
--Hello?

00:44:59.531 --> 00:45:00.782
Hello, who is this?

00:45:00.866 --> 00:45:03.619
- Hello? Who is this?

00:45:03.702 --> 00:45:06.163
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

00:45:06.246 --> 00:45:07.915
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

00:45:07.998 --> 00:45:09.207
-Yes.
-What did he say?

00:45:09.291 --> 00:45:11.418
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

00:45:11.501 --> 00:45:13.462
- And was someone else there?
- I...

00:45:13.545 --> 00:45:16.256
-Mom, who was there? Who was it?
-It was him.

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:19.051
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

00:45:20.344 --> 00:45:21.720
--Will!

00:45:22.721 --> 00:45:25.223
- Will!
- Byers!

00:45:25.307 --> 00:45:28.060
I've got your X-Men 134!

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:30.896
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

00:45:30.979 --> 00:45:32.230
Seriously, Dustin?

00:45:32.314 --> 00:45:34.608
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

00:45:34.691 --> 00:45:36.401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

00:45:36.485 --> 00:45:38.487
No, you're just being a big sissy!

00:45:39.112 --> 00:45:42.491
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

00:45:42.574 --> 00:45:45.452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

00:45:45.535 --> 00:45:48.372
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.

00:45:48.455 --> 00:45:50.457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

00:45:50.540 --> 00:45:52.668
- Shut up. Shut up.

00:45:52.751 --> 00:45:54.419
Did you guys hear that?
