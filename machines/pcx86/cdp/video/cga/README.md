We don't have a Columbia Data Products CGA card, so we cannot say to what extent it may differ from
an IBM CGA card (if at all).  All we have is what's believed to be a copy of their CGA character ROM,
and it is *identical* the CGA portion of the [IBM CGA](/machines/pcx86/ibm/video/cga/) character ROM.

### Columbia Data Products CGA Character ROM

There is only one known Columbia Data Products CGA Character ROM ([MPC_VID-1.0](MPC_VID-1.0.json5)), and it is
*identical* to the CGA portion of the [IBM CGA](/machines/pcx86/ibm/video/cga/) character ROM.

For reference, here are the first 0x80 bytes at offset 0x0000 from this ROM, which contain the font data for the first
16 8x8 characters:
