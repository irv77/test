PCjs includes 20Mb drives in selected IBM PC AT and COMPAQ DeskPro machines,
because both those machines support a 20Mb [Drive Type](../) with the following drive parameters:

    615 cylinders
    4 heads
    17 sectors/track

yielding a capacity of 21,411,840 bytes (615 * 4 * 17 * 512), or 20.42Mb (since PCjs considers 1 megabyte to be 1,048,576 bytes).
