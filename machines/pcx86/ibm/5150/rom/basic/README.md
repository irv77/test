PCjs contains the following IBM PC BASIC ROMs:

  - [IBM BASIC C1.00](BASIC100.json5)
  - [IBM BASIC C1.10](../../../5160/rom/basic/BASIC110.json5)

These built-in versions of BASIC were also referred to as Cassette BASIC, because no disk drive was required.
Only the original IBM PC (Model 5150) actually provided a cassette interface, but IBM continued to use that
name to describe the built-in BASIC, at least up through the IBM PC AT (Model 5170).

Both versions of Cassette BASIC were 32Kb and spanned physical addresses 0xF6000-0xFDFFF.  They were produced by
Microsoft, and unlike the IBM PC BIOS ROMs, no source code listings of these BASIC ROMs were ever published.
