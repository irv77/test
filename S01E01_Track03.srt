1
00:01:43,438 --> 00:01:47,150
Something is coming.
Something hungry for blood.

2
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:51,821
A shadow grows on the wall behind you,
swallowing you in darkness.

3
00:01:51,904 --> 00:01:53,865
-It is almost here.
-What is it?

4
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:55,283
What if it's the Demogorgon?

5
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:58,411
Oh, Jesus, we're so screwed
if it's the Demogorgon.

6
00:01:58,494 --> 00:01:59,537
It's not the Demogorgon.

7
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:01,873
An army of troglodytes
charge into the chamber!

8
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,083
- Troglodytes?
- Told ya.

9
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:08,963
Wait a minute.

10
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,591
Did you hear that?

11
00:02:11,674 --> 00:02:13,092
That... that sound?

12
00:02:13,176 --> 00:02:15,845
Boom... boom...

13
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:17,680
- Boom!

14
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,641
That didn't come from the troglodytes.
No, that...

15
00:02:19,724 --> 00:02:21,392
That came from something else.

16
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:25,855
- The Demogorgon!

17
00:02:25,938 --> 00:02:27,398
-We're in deep shit.
-Will, your action!

18
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:28,775
-I don't know!
-Fireball him!

19
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,151
I'd have to roll a 13 or higher!

20
00:02:30,234 --> 00:02:32,070
Too risky.
Cast a protection spell.

21
00:02:32,153 --> 00:02:34,697
-Don't be a pussy. Fireball him!
-Cast Protection.

22
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,492
The Demogorgon is tired
of your silly human bickering!

23
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,369
It stomps towards you.

24
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:40,453
-Boom!
-Fireball him!

25
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,830
-Another stomp, boom!
-Cast Protection.

26
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:45,750
- He roars in anger!

27
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,335
- Fireball!

28
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,045
- Oh, shit!
- Where'd it go?

29
00:02:49,128 --> 00:02:50,838
- Where is it?
- I don't know!

30
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:52,465
- Is it a 13?
- I don't know!

31
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:53,716
- Where is it?
- Oh, my God!

32
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,385
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

33
00:02:55,468 --> 00:02:56,552
- Mike!
- Can you find it yet?

34
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:57,720
No, I can't find it!

35
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,472
- Mike!
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

36
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:01,349
Mom, we're in the middle of a campaign!

37
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:03,559
You mean the end?
Fifteen after.

38
00:03:03,643 --> 00:03:06,813
- Oh, my God! Freaking idiot!
- Why do we have to go?

39
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:09,607
-Mom, wait, just 20 more minutes!
-It's a school night, Michael.

40
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,151
I just put Holly to bed.
You can finish next weekend.

41
00:03:12,235 --> 00:03:13,778
-But that'll ruin the flow!
-Michael--

42
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:15,113
I'm serious, Mom.

43
00:03:15,196 --> 00:03:17,657
The campaign took two weeks to plan.

44
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,659
How was I supposed to know
it was gonna take ten hours?

45
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,619
You've been playing for ten hours?

46
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:26,749
-Dad, don't you think that 20 more--
-I think you should listen to your mother.

47
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:30,294
--Dang dumb piece of junk.

48
00:03:31,337 --> 00:03:33,297
Oh, I got it!

49
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:35,258
-Does the seven count?
-It was a seven?

50
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,469
Did Mike see it?
Then it doesn't count.

51
00:03:43,099 --> 00:03:44,267
Yo, hey, guys.

52
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,227
- Does anyone want this?
- No.

53
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:50,857
Yeah.

54
00:03:51,649 --> 00:03:53,234
No, I don't think...

55
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,945
Yeah, he's cute.

56
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:59,365
Barb, no, I don't think so.

57
00:03:59,449 --> 00:04:00,908
-Barb, you're not--
-Hey, Nancy.

58
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,161
There's a slice left if you want it.

59
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,580
-Sausage and pepperoni!
-Hold on.

60
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:16,382
-There's something wrong with your sister.
-What are you talking about?

61
00:04:16,466 --> 00:04:18,259
- She's got a stick up her butt.
- Yeah.

62
00:04:18,342 --> 00:04:20,845
It's because she's been dating
that douchebag, Steve Harrington.

63
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,680
Yeah,
she's turning into a real jerk.

64
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,098
She's always been a real jerk.

65
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:26,058
Nuh-uh, she used to be cool.

66
00:04:26,142 --> 00:04:28,519
Like that time she dressed up as an elf
for our Elder tree campaign.

67
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:29,812
Four years ago!

68
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,355
- Just saying.
- Later.

69
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,984
-It was a seven.
-Huh?

70
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,819
The roll, it was a seven.

71
00:04:37,904 --> 00:04:40,114
The Demogorgon, it got me.

72
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:43,159
See you tomorrow.

73
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,844
- Good night, ladies.
- Kiss your mom 'night for me.

74
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,264
Race you back to my place?
Winner gets a comic.

75
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:07,016
-Any comic?
-Yeah.

76
00:05:07,892 --> 00:05:10,019
Hey! Hey!

77
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:12,063
I didn't say "go"!

78
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,150
Get back here!

79
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:18,361
I'm gonna kill you!

80
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:20,863
I'll take your X-Men 134!

81
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,704
Son of a bitch.

82
00:06:27,763 --> 00:06:29,140
Mom?

83
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:31,767
- Jonathan? Mom?

84
00:06:53,706 --> 00:06:56,417
- Hello? Hello?

85
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:31,405
And that's it
for News Center this morning.

86
00:09:31,489 --> 00:09:32,823
Thanks for joining us.

87
00:09:32,907 --> 00:09:35,201
Let's hand off now to Liz
at the news desk.

88
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:36,702
All right, thank you, Donna.

89
00:09:36,786 --> 00:09:37,870
Turning now to local news,

90
00:09:37,953 --> 00:09:41,373
we're getting reports of surges
and power outages all across the county.

91
00:09:41,457 --> 00:09:44,418
Last night, hundreds of homes
in East Hawkins were affected,

92
00:09:44,502 --> 00:09:46,879
leaving many residents in the dark.

93
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:49,090
The cause of the outage is still unknown.

94
00:09:49,173 --> 00:09:51,383
We reached out to Roane County
Water and Electric,

95
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:54,011
and a spokesperson says
that they are confident

96
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:56,680
power will be restored
to all remaining homes

97
00:09:56,764 --> 00:09:58,307
within the next several hours.

98
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,043
Mmm.

99
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,702
In other news,
you might wanna stay home tonight

100
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,078
or at least pack an umbrella.

101
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,581
We turn to everybody's favorite
morning weather guy, Charles.

102
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,087
Where the hell are they?

103
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,590
-Jonathan?
-Check the couch!

104
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:13,799
Ugh, I did.

105
00:11:14,925 --> 00:11:17,386
Oh... Got them.

106
00:11:18,512 --> 00:11:20,848
Okay, sweetie, I will see you tonight.

107
00:11:20,931 --> 00:11:22,766
-Yeah, see you later.
-Where's Will?

108
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:23,934
Oh, I didn't get him up yet.

109
00:11:24,018 --> 00:11:25,144
- He's probably still sleeping.

110
00:11:25,227 --> 00:11:28,355
-Jonathan, you have to make sure he's up!
-Mom, I'm making breakfast.

111
00:11:28,439 --> 00:11:30,274
I told you this a thousand times.

112
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:33,986
Will! Come on, honey.
It's time to get up.

113
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:40,743
-He came home last night, right?
-He's not in his room?

114
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,120
-Did he come home or not?
-I don't know.

115
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,455
-You don't know?
-No.

116
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,582
I got home late.
I was working.

117
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:47,708
You were working?

118
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,710
Eric asked if I could cover.
I said yeah.

119
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:51,253
I just thought we could use
the extra cash.

120
00:11:51,337 --> 00:11:54,048
-Jonathan, we've talked about this.
-I know, I know.

121
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:56,050
You can't take shifts when I'm working.

122
00:11:56,133 --> 00:11:58,302
Mom, it's not a big deal.
Look, he was at the Wheelers' all day.

123
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,055
- I'm sure he just stayed over.
- I can't believe you.

124
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,724
I can't believe you sometimes.

125
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:10,272
--That's disgusting.

126
00:12:10,356 --> 00:12:12,566
- You're disgusting!
- Hello?

127
00:12:12,650 --> 00:12:14,401
Hi, Karen.
It's Joyce.

128
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:16,528
- Oh, Joyce, hi.
- What the hell, Mike?

129
00:12:16,612 --> 00:12:17,780
- Hey!
- Quiet!

130
00:12:17,863 --> 00:12:19,573
-Language.
-Are you kidding?

131
00:12:19,657 --> 00:12:21,033
Was that Will I heard back there?

132
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,618
Will?
No, no, no, it's just Mike.

133
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:24,119
Will didn't spend the night?

134
00:12:24,203 --> 00:12:26,622
No, he left here
a little bit after 8:00.

135
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:28,040
Why? He's not home?

136
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:31,961
Um, you know what? I think
he just left early for... for school.

137
00:12:32,044 --> 00:12:34,046
-Thank you so much. Bye.
-Okay. Bye.

138
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:58,904
That's weird.
I don't see him.

139
00:12:58,988 --> 00:13:00,531
I'm telling you, his mom's right.

140
00:13:00,614 --> 00:13:02,449
He probably just
went to class early again.

141
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,035
Yeah, he's always paranoid
Gursky's gonna give him another pop quiz.

142
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,037
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

143
00:13:07,871 --> 00:13:10,374
Step right up and get your tickets
for the freak show.

144
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,085
Who do you think would make more money
in a freak show?

145
00:13:14,837 --> 00:13:18,757
Midnight, Frogface, or Toothless?

146
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,346
I'd go with Toothless.

147
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,891
I told you a million times,
my teeth are coming in.

148
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:29,727
It's called cleidocranial dysplasia.

149
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,812
"I told you a million times."

150
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:33,939
--Do the arm thing.

151
00:13:34,732 --> 00:13:36,066
Do it, freak!

152
00:13:42,406 --> 00:13:44,658
God, it gets me every time.

153
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:48,829
- Assholes.
- I think it's kinda cool.

154
00:13:48,912 --> 00:13:51,081
It's like you have superpowers
or something.

155
00:13:51,165 --> 00:13:53,042
Like Mr. Fantastic.

156
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,377
Yeah,
except I can't fight evil with it.

157
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:05,512
So, did he call?

158
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:08,140
Keep your voice down.

159
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:09,808
Did he?

160
00:14:09,892 --> 00:14:11,643
I told you, it's not like that.

161
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,981
Okay, I mean, yes, he likes me,
but not like that.

162
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,983
We just...

163
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:20,611
made out a couple times.

164
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:24,073
"We just... made out a couple times."

165
00:14:24,156 --> 00:14:25,491
Nance, seriously,

166
00:14:25,574 --> 00:14:27,659
you're gonna be so cool now,
it's ridiculous.

167
00:14:27,743 --> 00:14:29,161
No, I'm not.

168
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:32,915
You better still hang out with me,
that's all I'm saying.

169
00:14:32,998 --> 00:14:35,793
If you become friends with Tommy H.
or Carol--

170
00:14:35,876 --> 00:14:37,169
Oh, that's gross!

171
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,421
Okay,
I'm telling you, it was a one-time...

172
00:14:40,255 --> 00:14:42,341
- Two-time thing.

173
00:14:47,179 --> 00:14:48,472
You were saying?

174
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:00,359
-Steve...
-Mmm-hmm?

175
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,111
-I have to go.
-In a minute.

176
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:05,864
Steve.
I really, like...

177
00:15:05,948 --> 00:15:07,783
Seriously, I have to go.

178
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:09,243
Wait, wait, wait.
Let's...

179
00:15:09,326 --> 00:15:11,203
Come on, let's do something tonight, yeah?

180
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:14,206
Uh... No, I can't.
I have to study for Kaminsky's test.

181
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,542
Oh, come on.
What's your GPA again? 3.999...

182
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,335
Kaminsky's tests are impossible.

183
00:15:18,419 --> 00:15:20,587
-Well, then, just let me help.
-You failed chem.

184
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,673
-C-minus.
-Well, in that case...

185
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,092
So I'll be over around, say, like, 8:00?

186
00:15:25,175 --> 00:15:28,137
-Are you crazy? My mom would not--
-I'll climb through your window.

187
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:30,389
She won't even know I'm there.
I'm stealthy, like a ninja.

188
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:31,723
You are crazy.

189
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,642
Wait, wait, wait. Just...
Okay, forget about that.

190
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:35,018
We can just...

191
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:37,020
We can just, like, chill in my car.

192
00:15:37,104 --> 00:15:40,065
We can find
a nice quiet place to park, and...

193
00:15:40,149 --> 00:15:43,569
Steve... I have to study.

194
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,362
I'm not kidding.

195
00:15:45,446 --> 00:15:47,739
Well, why do you think
I want it to be nice and quiet?

196
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:51,493
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

197
00:15:57,458 --> 00:16:00,043
Meet me at Dearborn and Maple at 8:00.

198
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,254
To study.

199
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:16,768
Good of you to show.

200
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:20,522
Oh, hey, morning, Flo.
Morning, everybody.

201
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:24,276
-Hey, Chief.
-Damn! You look like hell, Chief.

202
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:25,360
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:27,988
Well, I looked better than your wife
when I left her this morning.

204
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,699
While you were drinking or sleeping,

205
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:33,744
or whatever it is you deemed
so necessary on Monday morning,

206
00:16:33,827 --> 00:16:34,828
Phil Larson called.

207
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,581
Said some kids are stealing
the gnomes out of his garden again.

208
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,124
Oh, those garden gnomes again.

209
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,460
Well, I'll tell you what,
I'm gonna get right on that.

210
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:43,086
On a more pressing matter,

211
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:45,214
Joyce Byers can't find her son
this morning.

212
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:48,050
Mmm.
Okay, I'm gonna get on that.

213
00:16:48,133 --> 00:16:50,344
-Just give me a minute.
-Joyce is very upset.

214
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:52,304
Well, Flo, Flo, we've discussed this.

215
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:54,723
Mornings are for coffee and contemplation.

216
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:58,685
-Chief, she's already in your--
-Coffee and contemplation, Flo!

217
00:17:09,154 --> 00:17:11,949
I have been waiting here
over an hour, Hopper.

218
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,618
And I apologize again.

219
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,078
I'm going out of my mind!

220
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,748
Look, boy his age,
he's probably just playing hookie, okay?

221
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,833
No, not my Will.
He's not like that.

222
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,460
-He wouldn't do that.
-Well, you never know.

223
00:17:23,544 --> 00:17:25,254
I mean, my mom thought
I was on the debate team,

224
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,922
when really I was just screwing
Chrissy Carpenter

225
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:28,674
in the back of my dad's Oldsmobile, so...

226
00:17:28,757 --> 00:17:31,718
Look, he's not like you, Hopper.
He's not like me.

227
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,304
He's not like... most.

228
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:38,267
He has a couple of friends,
but, you know, the kids, they're mean.

229
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:40,185
They make fun of him.
They call him names.

230
00:17:40,269 --> 00:17:42,312
-They laugh at him, his clothes--
-His clothes?

231
00:17:42,396 --> 00:17:44,356
-What's wrong with his clothes?
-I don't know.

232
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,733
-Does that matter?
-Maybe.

233
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:49,861
Look, he's...
He's a sensitive kid.

234
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:53,657
Lonnie...
Lonnie used to say he was queer.

235
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:55,075
Called him a fag.

236
00:17:55,158 --> 00:17:59,079
-Is he?
-He's missing is what he is.

237
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,958
When was the last time
you heard from Lonnie?

238
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:09,423
Uh, last I heard, he was in Indianapolis.
That was about a year ago.

239
00:18:09,506 --> 00:18:12,259
-But he has nothing to do with this.
-Why don't you give me his number?

240
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:14,219
You know, Hopper,
he has nothing to do with this. Trust me.

241
00:18:14,303 --> 00:18:17,514
Joyce, 99 out of 100 times,
kid goes missing,

242
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:19,725
the kid is with a parent or relative.

243
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,310
What about the other time?

244
00:18:21,393 --> 00:18:24,730
-What?
-You said, "99 out of 100."

245
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,857
-What about the other time, the one?
-Joyce.

246
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,066
The one!

247
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,985
- Joyce, this is Hawkins, okay?

248
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:31,820
You wanna know the worst thing
that's ever happened here

249
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:32,988
in the four years I've been working here?

250
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,239
Do you wanna know the worst thing?

251
00:18:34,323 --> 00:18:37,451
It was when an owl attacked
Eleanor Gillespie's head

252
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,244
because it thought
that her hair was a nest.

253
00:18:39,328 --> 00:18:41,997
Okay, fine.
I will call Lonnie.

254
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,790
He will talk to me before he talks to--

255
00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:45,834
-What, a pig?
-A cop!

256
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,921
Just find my son, Hop.

257
00:18:50,005 --> 00:18:51,882
Find him!

258
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:04,645
Dr. Brenner.

259
00:19:06,605 --> 00:19:08,273
This way, gentlemen.

260
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:11,193
The entire east wing
will be evacuated within the hour.

261
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:15,113
We've sealed off this area
following quarantine protocol.

262
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:03,930
- This is where it came from?
- Yes.

263
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,015
And the girl?

264
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,769
She can't have gone far.

265
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,740
All right, and one more.

266
00:22:04,699 --> 00:22:06,618
Hey, Ben.
What do you think about that, uh...

267
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:08,245
Hey, I don't know.
I don't know.

268
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,664
I don't know,
37 points per game average--

269
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:12,457
- Thirty-seven now, but...
- Mr. Basket.

270
00:22:42,612 --> 00:22:44,114
Hey!

271
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:45,323
Come here!

272
00:22:46,074 --> 00:22:47,367
Hey, come here!

273
00:22:52,038 --> 00:22:54,082
You think you can steal from me, boy?

274
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:57,752
What in the hell?

275
00:22:59,296 --> 00:23:02,132
--Remember, finish chapter 12

276
00:23:02,215 --> 00:23:06,011
and answer 12.3 on the difference
between an experiment

277
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:08,221
and other forms of science investigation.

278
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:12,183
This will be on the test,
which will cover chapters 10 through 12.

279
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:15,312
It will be multiple choice
with an essay section.

280
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,356
So, did it come?

281
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,816
Sorry, boys.

282
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,776
I hate to be the bearer of bad news,
but...

283
00:23:22,986 --> 00:23:23,903
it came.

284
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,491
Yes!

285
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:30,368
The Heathkit ham shack.

286
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:31,911
- Whoa.
- Ain't she a beaut?

287
00:23:31,995 --> 00:23:34,039
I bet you can talk to New York
on this thing.

288
00:23:34,122 --> 00:23:35,290
Think bigger.

289
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,375
-California?
-Bigger.

290
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:38,835
Australia?

291
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:41,379
--Oh, man!

292
00:23:41,463 --> 00:23:44,341
When Will sees this,
he's totally gonna blow his shit.

293
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:45,508
Lucas!

294
00:23:45,592 --> 00:23:46,968
- Sorry.

295
00:23:49,512 --> 00:23:51,931
Hello, this is Mike Wheeler,

296
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:54,726
president of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

297
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,479
What are you doing?

298
00:23:57,562 --> 00:23:58,730
Hello, this is Dustin,

299
00:23:58,813 --> 00:24:01,816
and this is the secretary and treasurer
of Hawkins Middle AV Club.

300
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:04,069
Do you eat kangaroos for breakfast?

301
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:11,076
Sorry to interrupt, but, uh, may I borrow
Michael, Lucas and Dustin?

302
00:24:16,081 --> 00:24:17,624
Okay, okay, okay.

303
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:20,669
One at a time, all right?
You.

304
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,380
-You said he takes what?
-Mirkwood.

305
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:26,049
-Mirkwood?
-Yeah.

306
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:29,636
-Have you ever heard of Mirkwood?
-I have not. That sounds made up to me.

307
00:24:29,719 --> 00:24:31,513
No, it's from Lord of the Rings.

308
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:34,474
-Well, The Hobbit.
-It doesn't matter.

309
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:36,393
- He asked!
- "He asked!"

310
00:24:36,476 --> 00:24:38,061
- Shut up, guys!
- Hey, hey, hey!

311
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:40,105
-What'd I just say?
-Shut up.

312
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:43,483
One at a damn time.
You.

313
00:24:43,566 --> 00:24:46,778
Mirkwood, it's a real road.
It's just the name that's made up.

314
00:24:46,861 --> 00:24:48,238
It's where Cornwallis and Kerley meet.

315
00:24:48,321 --> 00:24:50,824
-Yeah, all right, I think I know that--
-We can show you, if you want.

316
00:24:50,907 --> 00:24:52,242
I said that I know it!

317
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:54,244
-We can help look.
-Yeah.

318
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,246
- No.

319
00:24:56,329 --> 00:24:59,457
No.
After school, you are all to go home.

320
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:00,750
Immediately.

321
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,629
That means no biking around looking
for your friend, no investigating,

322
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:05,797
no nonsense.

323
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,841
This isn't some Lord of the Rings book.

324
00:25:07,924 --> 00:25:10,719
-The Hobbit.
-Shut up!

325
00:25:10,802 --> 00:25:12,178
- Hey!
- Stop it!

326
00:25:13,471 --> 00:25:15,390
Do I make myself clear?

327
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:25,150
Do I make myself... clear?

328
00:25:26,151 --> 00:25:27,944
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah.

329
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:41,499
Ring-a-ding-ding!

330
00:25:41,583 --> 00:25:43,293
Anybody home?

331
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:45,003
Password?

332
00:25:45,086 --> 00:25:47,046
Uh, Rada...

333
00:25:48,381 --> 00:25:50,884
Radaga-- Radagast?

334
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:53,386
Yeah. You may enter.

335
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,930
Thank you, sir.

336
00:25:56,931 --> 00:25:58,558
So, guess what?

337
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,102
I got off early and...

338
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:03,855
Ta-da!
Poltergeist.

339
00:26:03,938 --> 00:26:05,482
I... I thought I wasn't allowed to see it.

340
00:26:05,565 --> 00:26:06,941
I changed my mind.

341
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:09,819
As long as you don't have nightmares
for a week.

342
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,405
No, I won't.
I don't get scared like that anymore.

343
00:26:12,489 --> 00:26:13,490
Oh, yeah?

344
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:15,241
Not even of clowns?

345
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:16,409
No.

346
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,870
What about my witch?

347
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:20,371
-No. Mom...
-Ooh...

348
00:26:20,455 --> 00:26:22,290
-I'm not five anymore.
-But Will Byers...

349
00:26:22,373 --> 00:26:24,834
-I'm going to cook you up in my--
-Stop. That's so stupid. Mom!

350
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:30,298
Will?

351
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:31,966
- Will?
- Will?

352
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:34,761
Will?

353
00:26:37,722 --> 00:26:39,307
-Will?
-Will!

354
00:26:40,642 --> 00:26:42,101
- Will!
- Will?

355
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:43,728
Will!

356
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:45,480
Where are you?

357
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:56,074
Geez.

358
00:26:56,950 --> 00:26:58,701
Your parents forget to feed you?

359
00:27:02,372 --> 00:27:04,207
Is that why you ran away?

360
00:27:07,669 --> 00:27:08,878
They, uh...

361
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,047
They hurt you?

362
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:15,635
You went to the hospital, you got scared,

363
00:27:15,718 --> 00:27:17,387
you ran off, you wound up here,
is that it?

364
00:27:20,431 --> 00:27:21,641
All right.

365
00:27:23,476 --> 00:27:26,855
I'll give this back, all right?
And you can have as much as you want.

366
00:27:27,522 --> 00:27:28,940
All right?
Maybe even some ice cream.

367
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,109
But you gotta answer
a few of my questions first, all right?

368
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:34,445
We got a deal?

369
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:40,076
All right, let's start
with the easy stuff. All right?

370
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,538
My name's Benny.
Benny Hammond.

371
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,331
See? Like this. Here.

372
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:48,334
I got you.
Don't worry. It's okay.

373
00:27:48,418 --> 00:27:51,880
Nice to meet you, yeah.
And you are?

374
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,265
Eleven?

375
00:28:03,308 --> 00:28:04,601
What's that mean?

376
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:07,228
What's it mean?

377
00:28:08,313 --> 00:28:10,565
-No.
-Well, I'll be damned.

378
00:28:10,648 --> 00:28:12,358
She speaks.

379
00:28:12,442 --> 00:28:14,110
"No"? No, what?

380
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:18,907
All right.
I guess no more food, then.

381
00:28:18,990 --> 00:28:20,158
Eleven.

382
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,577
Yeah.

383
00:28:23,912 --> 00:28:25,455
What's it mean?

384
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:28,625
Eleven.

385
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:32,503
All right, then.

386
00:28:32,587 --> 00:28:34,339
Here you go.

387
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:36,174
Take it easy, take it easy.

388
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:41,179
Yeah, look, all I know
is that she's scared to death.

389
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:43,389
Yeah, I think
maybe she's been abused or...

390
00:28:43,473 --> 00:28:45,099
kidnapped or something.

391
00:28:46,601 --> 00:28:49,187
Yeah, it'd be great
if someone would come by.

392
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,733
Yeah, we're at 4819 Randolph Lane.
Yeah, Randolph.

393
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:22,387
Will Byers?

394
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,557
Will!

395
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,061
Will Byers?

396
00:29:33,064 --> 00:29:35,066
Come on, kid!

397
00:29:35,149 --> 00:29:36,401
Will?

398
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:41,322
--Hey! I got something.

399
00:29:48,371 --> 00:29:51,291
-That his bike?
-Yeah, he must have crashed.

400
00:29:52,583 --> 00:29:54,210
You think
he got hurt in the fall?

401
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,629
Not so hurt he couldn't walk away.

402
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:58,631
Bike like this is like
a Cadillac to these kids.

403
00:29:58,715 --> 00:30:00,341
He would've walked it home.

404
00:30:11,352 --> 00:30:12,312
...get off work if I win.

405
00:30:12,395 --> 00:30:14,063
Oh, Friday I'm supposed to...

406
00:30:14,147 --> 00:30:16,941
...but we will cover
whatever the damages are to your property.

407
00:30:17,025 --> 00:30:18,693
- It's just, um...
- That's for sure.

408
00:30:28,036 --> 00:30:29,203
Is Lonnie there?

409
00:30:29,287 --> 00:30:31,581
- Lonnie isn't here right now.
- Can you please--

410
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,541
-I told you, Lonnie's not here.
-Who is this?

411
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,626
-His girlfriend, Cynthia.
-Cynthia.

412
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,421
-Who the hell is this?
-Cynthia, this is Joyce.

413
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:40,256
-Who?
-Lonnie's ex-wife.

414
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:42,383
-I really need to speak to him--
-Lonnie's not here.

415
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:44,344
-Can you please put-- No!
-Why don't you call back later?

416
00:30:44,427 --> 00:30:45,636
No, not later. Now!

417
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,888
- Can--

418
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,389
- Bitch!
- Mom.

419
00:30:48,473 --> 00:30:50,933
-What?
-You have to stay calm.

420
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:00,735
Hey, you've reached Lonnie.

421
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,029
Leave a message
and I'll holler right back at ya.

422
00:31:03,112 --> 00:31:06,866
Lonnie, some teenager just hung up on me.

423
00:31:06,949 --> 00:31:09,452
Will is... is missing.
I don't know where he is.

424
00:31:09,535 --> 00:31:10,703
I need...

425
00:31:10,787 --> 00:31:13,373
I just need you to call me back,
please, just--

426
00:31:16,042 --> 00:31:17,794
- Damn it! Damn it!

427
00:31:17,877 --> 00:31:19,545
--Mom?

428
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:20,630
What?

429
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:23,841
Cops.

430
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:42,235
-It was just lying there?
-Yeah. Cal?

431
00:31:43,152 --> 00:31:46,823
-Did it have any blood on it, or--
-No, no, no, no, no...

432
00:31:46,906 --> 00:31:48,408
Phil?

433
00:31:48,491 --> 00:31:50,910
If you found the bike out there,
why are you here?

434
00:31:51,953 --> 00:31:54,831
- Well, he had a key to the house, right?
- Yeah.

435
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,250
So...

436
00:31:58,209 --> 00:31:59,377
maybe he came home.

437
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,504
You think I didn't check
my own house?

438
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:03,381
I'm not saying that.

439
00:32:04,298 --> 00:32:07,051
- Has this always been here?
- What? I don't know.

440
00:32:07,135 --> 00:32:09,971
Probably. I mean, I have two boys.
Look at this place.

441
00:32:11,597 --> 00:32:12,765
You're not sure?

442
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,736
Hey.

443
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:29,115
Hey, what's up with this guy, huh?

444
00:32:29,198 --> 00:32:31,701
Nothing, he's probably just hungry.
Come on.

445
00:33:50,655 --> 00:33:52,323
- Hey!
- Jesus!

446
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:54,992
What are you, deaf?
I've been calling you.

447
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:57,537
--What's going on?

448
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,831
Hello?

449
00:34:00,915 --> 00:34:04,001
-Are you sure you're okay, Chief?
-Listen, I want you to call Flo.

450
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:05,419
I want to get
a search party together, all right?

451
00:34:05,503 --> 00:34:08,631
All the volunteers she can muster.
Bring flashlights, too.

452
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:11,008
Hey, you think
we got a problem here?

453
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:20,810
We should be out there right now.
We should be helping look for him.

454
00:34:20,893 --> 00:34:22,770
We've been over this, Mike.
The chief says--

455
00:34:22,853 --> 00:34:24,355
-I don't care what the chief said.
-Michael!

456
00:34:24,438 --> 00:34:26,107
We have to do something.
Will can be in danger.

457
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:27,400
More reason to stay put.

458
00:34:27,483 --> 00:34:29,527
-Mom!
-End of discussion.

459
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:37,660
So... me and Barbara are gonna
study at her house tonight.

460
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,162
-That's cool, right?
-No, not cool.

461
00:34:40,246 --> 00:34:41,497
What? Why not?

462
00:34:41,581 --> 00:34:44,792
Why do you think?
Am I speaking Chinese in this house?

463
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:47,920
Until we know Will is okay, no one leaves.

464
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:49,797
-This is such bullshit.
-Language.

465
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,299
So we're under house arrest?

466
00:34:51,382 --> 00:34:53,301
Just because Mike's friend got lost
on the way home from...

467
00:34:53,384 --> 00:34:55,678
-Wait, this is Will's fault?
-Nancy, take that back.

468
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:57,305
-No!
-You're just pissed off

469
00:34:57,388 --> 00:34:59,348
'cause you wanna hang out with Steve.

470
00:35:00,975 --> 00:35:02,226
-Steve?
-Who is Steve?

471
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,729
-Her new boyfriend.
-You are such a douchebag, Mike!

472
00:35:04,812 --> 00:35:06,606
- Language!

473
00:35:08,274 --> 00:35:09,692
Nancy, come back.

474
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:11,777
Come back!

475
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:15,281
It's okay. It's okay, Holly.
Here, have some juice, okay?

476
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,033
You see, Michael?

477
00:35:17,116 --> 00:35:19,410
- You see what happens?
- What happens when what?

478
00:35:19,493 --> 00:35:23,080
I'm the only one acting normal here!
I'm the only one that cares about Will!

479
00:35:23,164 --> 00:35:25,207
That is really unfair, son.

480
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:26,500
We care.

481
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,174
-Mike!
-Let him go.

482
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:38,304
I hope you're enjoying your chicken, Ted.

483
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:40,598
What did I do?

484
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:45,519
Hey! What'd I do?

485
00:35:48,564 --> 00:35:50,608
- Will!
- Will Byers!

486
00:35:50,691 --> 00:35:51,734
Will!

487
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,653
Will, we're here for you, bud!

488
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:58,741
He's a good student.

489
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:02,244
- What?
- Will. He's a good student.

490
00:36:02,328 --> 00:36:03,954
Great one, actually.

491
00:36:04,455 --> 00:36:06,374
I don't think we've met.
Scott Clarke.

492
00:36:06,457 --> 00:36:09,752
Teacher, Hawkins Middle.
Earth and biology.

493
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,837
I always had
a distaste for science.

494
00:36:11,921 --> 00:36:13,881
Well, maybe you had
a bad teacher.

495
00:36:13,964 --> 00:36:16,300
Yeah, Ms. Ratliff
was a piece of work.

496
00:36:16,384 --> 00:36:19,011
Ratliff?
You bet.

497
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,263
She's still kicking around,
believe it or not.

498
00:36:21,347 --> 00:36:25,142
Oh, I believe it.
Mummies never die, so they tell me.

499
00:36:25,768 --> 00:36:27,269
Sarah, my daughter...

500
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:32,817
Galaxies, the universe, whatnot...
She always understood all that stuff.

501
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,361
I always figured there was enough
going on down here,

502
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,196
I never needed to look elsewhere.

503
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:39,490
Your daughter,
what grade is she?

504
00:36:39,573 --> 00:36:42,368
-Maybe I'll get her in my class.
-No, she, uh...

505
00:36:42,451 --> 00:36:44,995
She lives with her mom in the city.

506
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:48,541
Thanks for coming out, Teach.
We really appreciate it.

507
00:36:50,751 --> 00:36:53,629
-She died a few years back.
-Sorry?

508
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:54,964
His kid.

509
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:08,978
Lucas, do you copy?
It's Mike.

510
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,897
-Lucas?
-Hey, it's Lucas.

511
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:12,982
I know it's you.

512
00:37:13,065 --> 00:37:16,235
And say "over" when you're done talking
so I know when you're done. Over.

513
00:37:16,318 --> 00:37:17,945
I'm done. Over.

514
00:37:18,028 --> 00:37:20,448
I'm worried about Will. Over.

515
00:37:20,531 --> 00:37:22,575
Yeah.

516
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,328
This is crazy. Over.

517
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:28,038
I was thinking...

518
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:32,376
Will could've cast Protection last night,
but he didn't.

519
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:33,461
He cast Fireball.

520
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:37,298
-Over.
-What's your point? Over.

521
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:42,094
My point is... he could've played it safe,
but he didn't.

522
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:44,054
He put himself in danger
to help the party.

523
00:37:44,138 --> 00:37:45,264
Over.

524
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:50,478
Meet me in ten.
Over and out.

525
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,301
What are you doing here?

526
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,678
I told you on the phone,
I'm under house arrest now.

527
00:38:24,762 --> 00:38:27,598
-I figured we'd just study here.
-No. No way.

528
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,934
Oh, come on.
I can't have you failing this test.

529
00:38:30,017 --> 00:38:31,811
So just... bear with me.

530
00:38:34,855 --> 00:38:35,856
What'd I tell you?

531
00:38:37,274 --> 00:38:38,400
Ninja.

532
00:38:52,456 --> 00:38:53,916
You like that ice cream, huh?

533
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,585
Smile looks good on you.

534
00:38:57,419 --> 00:38:59,004
You know, smile?

535
00:39:08,013 --> 00:39:09,765
All right.
You just sit tight.

536
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:13,227
Whoever it is, I'll tell 'em to go away
real quick, all right?

537
00:39:15,437 --> 00:39:18,107
--Yeah, yeah, yeah...

538
00:39:19,233 --> 00:39:21,735
-Hey, can I help you?
-Hi, you must be Benny Hammond.

539
00:39:21,819 --> 00:39:24,071
I'm afraid I am. I'm afraid
we're closed for the evening, too.

540
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:26,907
-So try back tomorrow morning.
-Connie Frazier. Social Services.

541
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:29,869
Ah, Social Services. My apologies.
I didn't expect you so soon.

542
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:32,788
-That's a heck of a drive.
-Not too bad this time of night.

543
00:39:32,872 --> 00:39:35,124
Hey, listen, I...
I haven't told her that you're coming yet.

544
00:39:35,207 --> 00:39:39,169
I didn't want her running off again.
She's a tad skittish.

545
00:39:39,253 --> 00:39:41,881
-Children I work with usually are.
-Right, right.

546
00:39:42,464 --> 00:39:45,301
-So, where is she?
-Right. She's in the kitchen.

547
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:47,219
-Come on up. I'll introduce you.
-Thank you.

548
00:39:47,303 --> 00:39:49,096
Sorry again for trying
to turn you away there.

549
00:39:49,179 --> 00:39:50,222
-It's fine.
-You know, it's funny.

550
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:52,725
- Your, uh, voice sounds different on the--

551
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:26,467
Ah, man.
This is it.

552
00:40:35,225 --> 00:40:37,061
Hey, guys.
You feel that?

553
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,774
-I think maybe we should go back.
-No.

554
00:40:41,857 --> 00:40:44,485
We're not going back.
Just stay close.

555
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,694
Come on.

556
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,157
Just stay on channel six.
Don't do anything stupid.

557
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,163
Hey, guys, wait up.

558
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,123
Wait up!

559
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:06,799
"Which polymers occur naturally?"

560
00:41:08,217 --> 00:41:10,678
Starch and cellulose.

561
00:41:10,761 --> 00:41:12,012
Mmm.

562
00:41:12,096 --> 00:41:16,350
"In a molecule of CH4,

-Tetrahedrons.

564
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:21,480
Wow.
Jesus, how many of these did you make?

565
00:41:21,563 --> 00:41:23,399
You said you wanted to help.

566
00:41:24,441 --> 00:41:25,651
How about this? How about...

567
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:27,277
How about every time
that you get something right,

568
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:28,862
I have to take off
an item of clothing.

569
00:41:28,946 --> 00:41:30,531
But every time
that you get something wrong--

570
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:31,824
-Uh, pass.
-Oh, come on.

571
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:32,950
-Come on.
-No.

572
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:34,410
-Come on. It'll be fun.
-No.

Ooh, it's boiling points.

That's what I meant.

578
00:41:44,962 --> 00:41:46,964
Yeah, that's not what you said.

579
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,675
-No.
-No?

580
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:52,886
Oh, do you need...
Do you need help, or...

581
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:54,013
No.

582
00:42:15,534 --> 00:42:17,161
Steve.
Steve, come on.

583
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,245
What?

584
00:42:18,328 --> 00:42:20,456
Are you crazy?
My parents are here.

585
00:42:22,166 --> 00:42:24,668
That's weird, I... don't see them.

586
00:42:28,505 --> 00:42:33,177
Was this your plan all along?
To... to get in my room and then...

587
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,846
-get another notch on your belt.
-No. Nancy, no.

588
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,057
I'm not Laurie, or Amy, or Becky.

589
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:39,725
You mean, you're not a slut.

590
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:41,643
That's not what I'm saying.

591
00:42:41,727 --> 00:42:43,479
You know, you're so cute when you lie.

592
00:42:43,979 --> 00:42:45,230
Shut up.

593
00:42:48,108 --> 00:42:49,485
Bad Steve.

594
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:53,113
Bad.
Don't do that to Miss Nancy...

595
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,741
You're an idiot, Steve Harrington.

596
00:42:56,658 --> 00:42:58,702
You are beautiful, Nancy Wheeler.

You took these?

00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:20,015
These are great.

601
00:43:21,141 --> 00:43:24,103
Wow, they really are.

602
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:28,357
- I know I haven't been there for you.
- I've been...

603
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,526
working so hard and I...

604
00:43:30,609 --> 00:43:32,444
I just feel bad.
I don't even...

605
00:43:32,528 --> 00:43:34,988
barely know what's going on with you.

606
00:43:35,072 --> 00:43:37,825
All right?
I am sorry about that.

607
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:42,496
Hey, what is it?

608
00:43:43,413 --> 00:43:44,748
What is it, honey?

609
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:48,919
- Nothing.
- Tell me. Tell me.

610
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:51,046
-Come on. You can...
-No.

611
00:43:51,130 --> 00:43:52,297
It's just...

612
00:43:53,507 --> 00:43:55,300
I should've been there for him.

613
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:58,387
No. Oh, no.
You can't do that to yourself.

614
00:43:58,470 --> 00:44:01,682
This was not your fault.
Do you hear me?

615
00:44:01,765 --> 00:44:05,435
- He is... close.
- I know it.  I...

616
00:44:06,103 --> 00:44:08,814
I feel it in my heart.

617
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:12,359
You just have to...
You have to trust me on this, okay?

618
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:16,780
-Yeah.
-Oh, look at this.

619
00:44:16,864 --> 00:44:19,241
Look at this one.
Look at this one.

620
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,745
-I mean, that's it, right?
-Yeah.

621
00:44:23,829 --> 00:44:25,622
That's it.
That's the one.

622
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:32,129
- Hello?

623
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:33,839

-Hopper?

-Will?
-It's Will?

--Mom, it's Will?

630
00:44:50,439 --> 00:44:51,857
- Who is this?

631
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:54,067
- What have you done to my boy?
- What? What?

632
00:44:54,151 --> 00:44:55,652
Give me back my son!

633
00:44:57,613 --> 00:44:59,448
--Hello?

634
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:00,782
Hello, who is this?

635
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:03,619
- Hello? Who is this?

636
00:45:03,702 --> 00:45:06,163
- Mom, who was it? Who was it, Mom?

637
00:45:06,246 --> 00:45:07,915
- It was him.
- Look at me, Mom. Was it Will?

638
00:45:07,998 --> 00:45:09,207
-Yes.
-What did he say?

639
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:11,418
He just breathed.
He just breathed.

640
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,462
- And was someone else there?
- I...

641
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:16,256
-Mom, who was there? Who was it?
-It was him.

642
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:19,051
I know it was his breathing.
I know it was his breathing.

643
00:45:20,344 --> 00:45:21,720
--Will!

644
00:45:22,721 --> 00:45:25,223
- Will!
- Byers!

645
00:45:25,307 --> 00:45:28,060
I've got your X-Men 134!

646
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:30,896
Guys, I really think
we should turn back.

647
00:45:30,979 --> 00:45:32,230
Seriously, Dustin?

648
00:45:32,314 --> 00:45:34,608
You wanna be a baby,
then go home already!

649
00:45:34,691 --> 00:45:36,401
I'm just being realistic, Lucas!

650
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,487
No, you're just being a big sissy!

651
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:42,491
Did you ever think Will went
missing because he ran into something bad?

652
00:45:42,574 --> 00:45:45,452
And we're going to the exact same spot
where he was last seen?

653
00:45:45,535 --> 00:45:48,372
-And we have no weapons or anything?
-Dustin, shut up.

654
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:50,457
I'm just saying,
does that seem smart to you?

655
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,668
- Shut up. Shut up.

656
00:45:52,751 --> 00:45:54,419
Did you guys hear that?
